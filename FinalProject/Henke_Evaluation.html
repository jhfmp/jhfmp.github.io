<h1> <u>Mr. Henke's Evaluation Report</u> </h1>

<h2> <i>Participants:</i></h2>
 <p>Evaluator 1 is a parent of one of my students. Here name is Cindy. She is part of my target audience for my classroom website. I feel as
     though receiving feedback from my target audience will help me build a better and more effective website tailored to the needs and 
     preferences of my end users. Cindy used an HP computer. She said it has an i5 Core processor, and 8GB of RAM. She viewed my pilot site
     while using Google Chrome web browser. She did not indicate what operating system her computer runs.</p>
 <p>Evaluator 2 is a coworker at my school. She took this course over the summer, so she has experience coding a similar website. Her name is 
     Sally. She also was my observed evaluators. I selected to observe her since she could give live feedback to the coding if she came across 
     any particular issues. Sally used a Dell laptop. It had an Intel Core i7 processor. It ran Windows 10 operating system, and had 8GB RAM.</p>
 <p>Evaluator 3 is another parent of one of my students. She, too, is part of my target audience. Her name is Kacie. Her computer was a Lenovo 
     laptop, which ran Windows 7 operating system. It had 4GB RAM and an AMD A4 processor.</p>

<h2><i>Summary of Evaluators' Comments</i></h2>
<p>Overall, the evaluators liked my classroom website. A common bit of feedback I was to look into the greens that I selected for my color scheme.
    A fellow classmate and evaluator 1 both stated this could be an issue. Evaluator 2 said the color scheme was consistent, but possibly bland. 
    Since some users weren't too keen on the greens, and another user indentified the scheme as bland it will be an area to investigate possible
    alternatives.</p>
<p>Additionally, many of the evalutors pointed out that the final two pages of the website need to be completed. I still need to complete the
    Useful Documents page, and the Educational Games page. This will provide a more complete and better end user expereince once these have 
    been completed.</p>
<p>When I observed evaluator 2 navigate the website, we noticed there are some issues with the positioning of the navigational links on the
    top of Important Documents and Educational Games. They do not match up with the rest of the pages on the website. In order to ensure 
    consistency, I will need to correct this issue. Evaluator 2 atttempted to help me figure out why the code in these 2 pages was creating a 
    slightly different expereince than the rest of the pages, but we were unable to determine where the mistake was made. This is something I 
    work on sorting out for the final version of my website.</p>

<h2> <i>Evaluator Data:</i></h2>

<p>Here is the data from the 3 evaluators who provided feedback on my website.<p> 
    <ul>
        <li><a href=evaluation1.docx> Evaluator 1</a></li>
        <li><a href=evaluation2.docx> Evaluator 2</a></li>
        <li><a href=evaluation3.docx> Evaluator 3</a></li></ul>

<h2>Recommended/Planned Changes</h2>
    <p>Here are the changes I plan on making after receiving evaluator feedback:</p>
<h3>Improving Design and Navigation</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Conistency on the navigation links from page to page. Currently, there are some differences that require attention.</li>
        <li>There was some feedback quenstioning aspects of the color combinations I selected. One person in the peer feedback on our Mizzou 
            forum stated the greens did not have too much contrast. Evaluator 1 also echoed this about the green.</li>
        <li>It was also mentioned that the color combinations could be improved in general. I will look into different color combinations to 
            see if a better combination can be found to meet the needs of my website.</li>
        <li>There are some spelling mistakes that must be addressed as well.</li>
    </ul>
<h3>Enriching Content</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The Red, White, and Blue calendar needs to be updated now that it is October.</li>
        <li>Complete the Important Documents page, and Educational Games page.</li>
    </ul>
<h3>Enhancing Credibility</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>An evaluator as well as the course instructor suggested getting permission to link educational games from another site.
            I have sent a request to the educational website I was going to use. At this time, I have not received a response.</li>
    </ul>
<h3>Revising Code</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>I need to update the code on my Important Documents and Educational Games pages. The navigation bar links on these pages 
            do not match the navigation bar links on the rest of my website.</li>
        <li>The developer tester also provided a lot of valuable feedback to make my coding more effiecient. It helped sort out many errors 
            and ensured the website was able to be validated.</li>    
        </ul>

<h2><i>Reflections on Evaluation Process:</i></h2>
    <p>Evaluations are always a useful way to find out more about something one has created. It is difficult to know if something that makes 
        sense to one person will make sense to others. The only real way to know for sure is to get feedback from other people. That is exactly
        the reason why receiving feedback on our websites is so valuable. I do not know if the layout of my site is good unless I ask another
        person their opinion on it.</p>
    <p>After asking several people to look at my website, I received feedback that will help me improve the site to meet all of its intended 
        purposes. I know I need to complete 2 pages that will allow me to satisfy 2 of my Use Cases. One being a parent who needs to get a 
        useful document that might have been lost when it was sent home. The Use Case is a student who needs to practices skills at home with
        an education game that is linked on my site.</p>
    <p>Additionally, I know there may be some improvements that can be made with my color combination choices. Also, some spelling mistakes 
        need to be corrected, and finally there is some coding that can be sorted out to improve consistency of the website. Without the 
        evaluation process I might not have noticed these things on my own. By using the process I now know of these issues and work to fix
        them. This will help me create an even better classroom website than I could have created on my own.</p>
