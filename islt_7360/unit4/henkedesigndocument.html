<h1> <u>Mr. Henke's Classroom Webpage</u> </h1>

<h2> <i>Purpose:</i></h2>

<p>The purpose of my teacher website is to create a valuable online reference tool for parents to access upcoming information about the school year, obtain important documents, and to easily be able to find my contact information. I also want my website to house links and resrources students can access in order to gain access to additional practice and study tools. </P> 
<p>Parents often need access to fieldtrip forms or other permission slips which do not always make it home with students when sent in their take home folders. Also, some students spend the weekend with one parent, but live with the other parent the majority of the time. The documents might end up at one house when the other parent is the one who is the main educational decision maker. Being able to quickly access a digital copy and print off a hard copy would certainly make things easier for some families. </p> 
<p>Many of my students need extra practice to learn or master certain skills. Their parents would love to have a place where their children could go to access online content with suggested links for games practicing a variety of skills. My website will contain a section that has links to good practice sites for reading, math, and other skills my students requrie. </p>
<hr>
<h2><i>Use Cases</i></h2>
<ol>
    <li>A parent has lost a permission slip for an upcoming field trip. The parent needs to have the form turned in by Monday. Today is the Saturday before the due date, and cannot get another hardcopy of the form before it is due. The parent accesses the Important Documents section of my website, prints off the form, fills it out, and sends it in on Monday with the student.</li>
    <li>A parent wants to make sure the student is dressed appropriately for the day when the student has PE. The parent knows PE is on red days for the student, but cannot recall when the next red day will be because the specials calendar is on a 3 day rolling calendar. The parent accesses the calendar section on my classroom website and looks up the schedule.</li>
    <li>A student requires more practice reading sight words, but does not like the review and drill practice of flashcards at home. The student goes to the Educational games section of my classroom website, and finds educational games centered around sight words.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
    <h2> <i>Audience:</i></h2>
<p>The target audience for my website will be the parents of my students, and my students themselves. I believe the parents will be the main users, though. As I described in the purpose, the parents will be able to access content, documents, calendars, etc. The students will only access the site to get pre-selected links that will help them practice various skills at home.  </p>
<hr>

<h2> <i>Needs Assessment:</i></h2>
<p>I sent home a survey to 4 parents of the students on my current caseload. I asked them what would be the most useful information to include on the website. They said a calendar that shows whether it is a red, white, or blue day would be very useful. My school rotates specials based on the color of the day, so Art, PE, and Music never fall on the same day of the week. Being able to look at this information ahead of time would make it easier to know what kind of outfit their children should wear. Other commonly asked for information was access to important documents, and a place where their students can find games to practice different skills. </p>
<h3> Questions asked to the group: </h3>
<p><i>What type of information would you find most helpful on a classroom web site?</i></p>
<ul>
    <li>All parents said they would like access to educational games for their children to practice skills at home.</li>
    <li>3 parents requeted a red, white, and blue calendar in order to know which specials class their student would have that day.</li>
    <li>2 parents requested a place to find and print off important documents we send home; such as permission slips.</li>
</ul>
<p><i>What would you not like the classroom web site to be?</i></p>
<p>The parents mostly reponded they did not want the classroom web site to be one more thing they have to do on a regular basis. They prefer it to have content available to them, but nothing required out of them. One parent mentioned they did not want repeated information from the main district site. Preferably, it would be specific to everything going on in my classroom.</p>
<p><i>What subject areas are the most difficult for you to find ways for your child to practice at home?</i></p>
<ul>
    <li>math - 2 parents said counting, and the other 2 said addition</li>
    <li>reading</li>
</ul>
<h3> <i>5 Reference Websites:</i></h3>
<ul>
    <li>Here is an example of a classroom website with <a href="http://www.jbonzer.com/">poor navigation design.</a></li>
    <li>Here is an example of a classroom website with <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/jgeocarisenglish/">good navigation design.</a></li>
    <li>Here is an example of a classroom website with <a href="http://missbakersbiologyclass.com/blog/">poor layout.</a> There is a lot of content in the middle of the page, which makes it difficult to use.</li>
    <li>Here is an example of a classroom website with questionable layout, but <a href="http://earhart.goddardusd.com/49583_3">good quality content.</a> This classroom website has a section for students to access educational games and practice material covered in class.</li>
    <li>Here is an example of a classroom website with <a href="http://mrsmith-online.weebly.com/">pleasant color combinations.</a></li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2> <i>Content:</i></h2>
<p>The following is the content that will be included in my web site. This infomation is based on the survey responses and personal preferences.</p>
<ul>
    <li>About Me - A page where parents and students can find information about me and how they can contact me.</li>
    <li>Calendar - This will have important event dates, in addition to the red, white, and blue schedule for scpecials classes.</li>
    <li>Important Documents - A place where parents can open and print off permission slips, forms, etc. that may have been misplaced.</li>
    <li>Educational Games - This is where the students can go to find links to fun games that will help them practice skills at home.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2><i>Presentation of Information/Rationale of Organization:</i></h2>
<p>My classroom website will be hierarchical. Additional supporting pages will center around the main idea of a classroom website.</p>
<ul>
    <li>I want my website to be <b>easy to use, consisent, only include useful and non distracting information and images, and be intuitive.</b>
<ul>
    <li>In order to be easy to use, all of the sections of my website will be clearly labeled.</li>
    <li>Consistency helps users feel comfortable on a website. In order to achieve consistency, all of the navigation buttons, colors, fonts, and banner images will be the same and in the same place to help the users find them easier.</li>
    <li>No distracting images or moving text boxes will be included in my site. These are often found on classroom website. These will be avoided.</li>
    <li>My hope is to create a website that users can use naturally. I want it to be an inutitve experience that does make the experience feel like a chore to the user.</ul></li>
<li>The Home Page
<ul>
    <li>There will be 4 large navigation buttons on along the top of the home page, just below the banner, which will allow users to navigate to the sub-pages of the web site.</li>
    <li>The 4 buttons will be: About Me, Calendar, Important Documents, and Educational Games.</li>
    <li>There will be a welcome message, a section that explains the contents of the web site, and a picture of the classroom.</ul></li>
<li>Sub-Pages
<ul>
<li>Each will have the same banner for consistency across the website.</li>
<li>Each will have the same naviagtion buttons along the top of the page.</li>
<li>The color scheme used will be consisent.</li>
<li>I will try to keep the screen length size reasonable to ensure users do not have to scroll too far to find the useful information.</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>The following details the content of the proposed pages:</p>
<ul>
    <li><u>About Me</u>
        <ul>
            <li>This will be where parents and students can read more about my interests,</li>
            <li>why I became a teacher,</li>
            <li>how they can contact me,</li>
            <li>and where they can find pictures of me and my family.</ul></li>
        <li><u>Calendar</u>
        <ul> 
            <li>This will have important classroom dates.</li>
            <li>Also, parents will be able to check the rotating red, white, and blue schedule to determine what specials class their child will have that day.</ul></li>
        <li><u>Important Documents</u>
        <ul> 
            <li>Parents can print permission slips.</li>
            <li>Waiver forms</li>
            <li>Contact sheets</li>
            <li>Newsletters</ul></li>
        <li><u>Educational Games</u>
        <ul> 
            <li>Students will be able to access pre-selected educational games from various websites.</li>
            <li>There will be links to games for counting.</li>
            <li>There will be links to games for simple addition and subtraction.</li>
            <li>There will also be links to games for reading games.</li>
            <li>The games will be organized into categories to make it easy for the users to locate them.</ul></li>
    </ul>

<h2><i>Media:</i></h2>
<p>I plan to create an original banner in Photoshop using an image I capture. It will most likely be a picture of my classroom, or some part of my classroom. There will be some pictures of myself, and my family in the "About Me" sections of the website. These, too, will be original images. All images will be optimized for web use to ensure the pages load fast and are sized appropriately. I will include a footer statement such as "All material in this site is original and created by the site owner, Joe Henke. Any further use of the material is prohibited without permission from the site owner."</p>
<hr>

<h2><i>Color scheme and rationale:</i></h2>
<p>The color scheme of my website is by no means finalized. I know I want to select pleasing colors that work well together, as one of the goals of my website is to make it intutive and easy to use. Distracting and harsh colors take away from that experience. Currently, I plan to use a light blue background and black text for the main parts of my website. Links will be dark blue. Viewed links will be green. The dark blue will also be used in the navigation buttons on my website. I plan to incorporate the colors as effectively as possible in the banner image as well.</p>
<p id="rcorners3">Light Blue</p>
<p id="rcorners4">Dark Blue</p>
<p id="rcorners5">Green</p>
